    text: "After following Ismael's sale of my parents' house, I decided to ask for advice on possible investments. He was tireless in the search for the best solutions for me and my family. Helped me at every stage of the process, from buying to remodeling and then selling. In less than 6 months I managed to quadruple the invested capital! He walked me through some of the biggest decisions I have had to make — for that I am forever grateful. We will certainly do more business together.",

    text: "My family and I moved to Lisbon in August 2022 and Ishmael was a major part of our move. We actually 'found' him by mistake after a poor experience with another agency — and it turned out to be the best thing. Ishmael went above and beyond expectations: securing an apartment, guiding us through public services, applying for our NIFs, even picking us up at the airport. He did countless video calls while we were still in the US. His service was professional, personal, and ongoing even after we settled. We highly recommend him. Fantastic human being! Bonus: He speaks several languages — communication was effortless.",
